<h1>Retirement Analytics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on developing a comprehensive retirement analytics model. The analysis incorporated key financial variables, including stock growth, inflation rates, and Social Security adjustments, to forecast year-over-year 401K balances and expenses. Detailed calculations were performed to determine optimal withdrawal amounts from 401K accounts, considering projected Social Security income and retirement needs. The results provided a clear financial plan, ensuring sufficient retirement income over time while managing withdrawal rates. This model supports strategic decision-making for retirement planning, offering a valuable tool for long-term financial security analysis.

In this Excel project, Mathematical formulas were used to calculate the following:

1. Stock Growth and Inflation: Includes annual assumptions for stock growth and inflation rates.
2.401K Balance and Social Security Income: Tracks the year-by-year 401K balance, Social Security (SS) income, and retirement expenses.
3. Withdrawal Calculations: Details the amount withdrawn from the 401K to cover retirement expenses, including the percentage of withdrawal each year.
