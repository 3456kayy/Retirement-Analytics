<h1>Retirement Analytics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on developing a retirement analytics model for users to plan and assess their retirement. The analysis incorporated crucial financial variables, including stock growth, inflation rates, and Social Security adjustments, to forecast ongoing yearly 401K balances and expenses. Calculations were performed to determine optimal withdrawal amounts from 401K accounts, considering projected Social Security income and retirement needs. The results provided a clear financial plan, ensuring sufficient retirement income over time while managing withdrawal rates. This model supports strategic decision-making for long-term financial security analysis.

In this Excel project, mathematical formulas were used to calculate the following:

1. Stock Growth and Inflation: Includes annual assumptions for stock growth and inflation rates.
2. 401K Balance and Social Security Income: Tracks the year-by-year 401K balance, Social Security (SS) income, and retirement expenses.
3. Withdrawal Calculations: Details the amount withdrawn from the 401K to cover retirement expenses, including the percentage of withdrawal each year.
